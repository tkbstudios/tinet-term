# [DEPRECATED] TINET Terminal

Services will need to make their own terminals to interact with their own services.

Create a .env file (tinet-term dir) with the following structure:
```
CALC_ID=calcid
USERNAME=username
TOKEN=token
```

then run `python tinet-term.py` and you'll get a fully functional terminal to TINET.  
It simulates the connection to the TINET server.
